\usage{
barplot3d(z, dimensions, xlabels = names(z), yscale = "front",
  scalexy = 1, scalez = 1, gap = 0.2, alpha = 1, colors = NA,
  linecol = "black", theta = 15, phi = 15, fov = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{Numeric vector of the heights of each column}

\item{dimensions}{Numeric vector of length two; the number of rows and columns of the base of the plot}

\item{scalexy}{Numeric value used to scale the x and y coordinates (i.e. the "fatness" of the columns). Also scales the gap between columns}

\item{scalez}{Numeric value used to scale the z input vector. Useful for playing with data, but not recommended}

\item{gap}{Numeric value determining the gap between columns; this gap is identical in the x and y dimensions}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value determining the transparency of all column sides. Ranges beween 0 (invisible) and 1 (opaque)}

\item{colors}{Colour of columns.  Either a single colour or a character vector of colours, one for each column}

\item{linecol}{Colour of edges of columns. A single colour.}

\item{theta}{Polar coordinate (i.e. viewing angle) to be passed to rgl.viewpoint()}

\item{phi}{Polar coordinate (i.e. viewing angle) to be passed to rgl.viewpoint()}

\item{fov}{Field of view angle in degrees to be passed to rgl.viewpoint()}

\description{
Creates 3D barplots, with many configurable options. For detailed usage, please read the accompanying vignette.
}
\details{
Produces a 3D barplot using a numeric vector of values. The \code{\link{rgl}} package is used to draw the plots.
Further details are available in the accompanying vignette.
